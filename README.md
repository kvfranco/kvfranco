## Hello world! ðŸ‘‹
I'm passionate about application development and automation, constantly exploring the world of Full Stack and DevOps. Currently learning Front-End technologies and DevOps, I aim to create efficient and innovative solutions. I also run my own server 24/7, hosting services and applications using Docker, LXC, and VMs with Proxmox VE, while diving deeper into infrastructure and DevOps technologies. ðŸš€
